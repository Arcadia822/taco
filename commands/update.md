# Update Taco review artifact

## User input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

The user input may contain one feature-directory path followed by repeatable `--ignore <feature-relative-path-or-glob>` options. This command is also invoked by mandatory lifecycle hooks, where input is normally empty.

## Procedure

1. Work from the repository root. Confirm `.specify/` and `.specify/extensions/taco/bin/taco.mjs` exist. If either is missing, stop with the exact missing path.
2. Resolve the feature directory:
   - If the user supplied a path, resolve that exact path and require `<path>/spec.md`.
   - When invoked as a lifecycle hook, use the exact feature directory produced or changed by the immediately preceding Spec Kit command.
   - Otherwise use the active core Spec Kit integration's project-level feature resolver and read its `FEATURE_DIR` result.
   - If these sources do not identify exactly one feature directory, stop and ask for the path. Never select by modification time.
3. Run the installed extension CLI without network access:

   ```bash
   node .specify/extensions/taco/bin/taco.mjs pack "<FEATURE_DIR>" \
     --project-root "<REPOSITORY_ROOT>" \
     [--ignore "<PATTERN>"]... \
     --json
   ```

   Do not supply `--output`: the CLI owns the canonical in-directory Taco filename. On refresh it automatically reads that existing Taco so review threads, document identity, and explicit ignores are preserved.

4. Parse the JSON response. Require a successful result, a nonzero file count, and output exactly `<FEATURE_DIR>/<FEATURE_DIRECTORY_NAME>.taco.html`.
5. Present the generated Taco to the user:
   - Always use the active Agent GUI's native clickable local-file or artifact presentation for the exact absolute output path.
   - In Codex, emit a clickable absolute file link and do not attempt to navigate Browser directly to `file://`; the user's click hands the file to Browser, like opening a local note attachment.
   - In another Agent GUI, open and verify the Taco directly only if that GUI explicitly supports autonomous local HTML navigation. Otherwise keep the same clickable-file handoff and state that it was not opened automatically.
   - Never substitute a `data:` URL, development application, different Taco, external upload, or weakened browser security setting for the local file.
6. Report the absolute Taco path, embedded file count, default exclusions, explicit exclusions, preserved comment count, and presentation status. Distinguish `presented as a clickable file` from `opened and verified`; in Codex the expected state before user interaction is the former. State that the reviewer must save the Taco after editing or commenting before `__SPECKIT_COMMAND_TACO_REVIEW__` can import it.

## Agent invariant

Whenever you modify any canonical artifact inside a Spec Kit feature directory outside a lifecycle hook—including specification, clarification, plan, tasks, research, data model, contracts, checklists, or recorded implementation progress—run this command before reporting that operation complete.

## Constraints

- The feature directory remains canonical; Taco is a review transport.
- Never delete feature files during update.
- Never hand-edit the generated HTML shell.
- Never add `--force` to a Taco command.
- Do not silently omit a visible unsupported path. Report the CLI failure and let the user explicitly exclude it.

## Done when

- The in-directory Taco exists at the reported path.
- Its result identifies the same feature root as the active Spec Kit feature.
- Its embedded file count is nonzero and all exclusions are reported.
- The Taco is exposed through the Agent GUI's native clickable local-file presentation. A direct-open result is reported separately and only when the GUI supports autonomous local HTML navigation.
- The reviewer has the explicit next command: `__SPECKIT_COMMAND_TACO_REVIEW__ <path-to-file.taco.html>`.
